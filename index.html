              <p>
                We believe hiking has the power to transform lives. Sometimes, finding the perfect hike can be hard. Choosing and planning a hike should be fun, but often the process is frustrating and the information is hard to find. Not anymore!
<br> <br>
                The Hiking Club is an online platform that turns trail information into a range of personalised, self-guided hikes designed to suit your preferences, fitness and interests.<br> <br>
               
                Looking for details about travel restrictions, trail status and hiker responsibilities for hiking in the Alps? 
                See how Covid-19 may impact your hiking plans.<br> <br>

                Whether you're new to an area and hoping to learn about all of the recreational opportunities around or you've lived in the same place forever and think you know the trails like the back of your hand, there's always an opportunity to learn from those around you. The members of your hiking club will be more than happy to chat about their favorite hikes, waterfalls and swimming holesâ€”and you may just come away with some new adventures to add to your outdoor bucket list. <br> <br>

The knowledge doesn't stop at new trails. From tree and plant identification, to the history of the area you are hiking through, your fellow hiking club members will share their knowledge with you and help you learn more about the place you call home.
